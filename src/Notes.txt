Definitions:
    Composition -> Given two entities of the same sort, we can compose them into a new one. 
    Objects being flexible and having no structure, can be combined together into more of the same, 
    whereas solid objects cannot. Abstract concepts such as the ones we manipulate in the context of programming, 
    on the other hand, often offer us the possibility to combine.

    Pure functions -> Functions in which the output only depends on the input are called pure, 
    and enjoy the property of referential transparency.
